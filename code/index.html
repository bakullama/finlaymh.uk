	<h2>
	    About Me
	</h2>
	<p>
	    I'm a student in the UK studying a degree in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the University of Liverpool.        
	    In my free time I like running, hiking, climbing, programming (see github), doing CTFs on hackthebox, electronics, and playing around with linux.
	</p>
	<h2>
	    Programming I've done
	</h2>
	<p>
	    The more notable projects on my github include a <a href="https://github.com/bakullama/neuralnet">neural network in C++</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/bakullama/network-sonar-c">network visualiser</a> I wrote in C.
	    <br>
	    My A Level Computer Science project is also available to <a href="https://github.com/bakullama/A-Level-NEA">view</a>, which was a neural network that can recognise faces in images, written in C++
	    <br>
	    There's also a <a href="https://github.com/bakullama/Formula1">Formula 1 race leaderboard lookup tool</a>, but I wrote it a while ago so I'm not sure if it still works.
	    <br>
	    You can see more of my code on my github. 
	</p>

	<p>
	    Here are some things that I know about and have done
	    <ul>
		<li>
		    I can program in C/C++, Python, Visual Basic, Bash, a bit of Assembly and can vaguely use html
		</li>
		<li>
		    I run a TOR relay node which can be viewed <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/90B64F9E18B59AF322EBD28B8F8CD65C53E10CE1">here</a>
		</li>
		<li>
		    I'm pretty experienced with linux (I use arch by the way)
		</li>
		<li>
		    I have A levels in Maths, Physics and Computer Science
		</li>
		<li>
		    I have Bronze, Silver and Gold Duke Of Edinburgh awards
		</li>
		<li>
		    I can run a half marathon in just under 1.5 Hours, my next goal is a 50km ultramarathon, because I thought it would be funny to run an ultra before a regular marathon
		</li>
		<li>
		    In the summers of 2018 and 2019 I attended the CyberFirst Summer camps run by the NCSC and Smallpeice Trust. In this course I learned about OSINT, Network Security, Digital Forensics, Pentesting and Cryptography
		</li>
		<li>
		    A few years ago, I spent some time working at <a href="https://www.youview.com/">YouView</a> in their test automation team, where I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/bakullama/hag">frontend</a> for their jenkins test system
